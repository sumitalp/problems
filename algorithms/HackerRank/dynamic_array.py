'''
Declare a 2-dimensional array, , of  empty arrays. All arrays are zero indexed.
Declare an integer, , and initialize it to .

There are  types of queries, given as an array of strings for you to parse:

Query: 1 x y
Let .
Append the integer  to .
Query: 2 x y
Let .
Assign the value  to .
Store the new value of  to an answers array.
Note:  is the bitwise XOR operation, which corresponds to the ^ operator in most languages. Learn more about it on Wikipedia.  is the modulo operator.
Finally, size(arr[idx]) is the number of elements in arr[idx]

Function Description

Complete the dynamicArray function below.

dynamicArray has the following parameters:
- int n: the number of empty arrays to initialize in 
- string queries[q]: query strings that contain 3 space-separated integers

Returns

int[]: the results of each type 2 query in the order they are presented
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, , the size of  to create, and , the number of queries, respectively.
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a query string, .

Constraints

It is guaranteed that query type  will never query an empty array or index.
Sample Input

2 5
